[![Gitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20gitter-yellow.svg)](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/vscode)In any case, even if it is an open source project license, it is not necessary to reveal every project to others. I have clearly separated this matter and it does not conflict with any license.  Which projects are mine or have I completed them?  That would mean that I am the law and the person controlling the authorization, which for me requires only sending documents for me to sign to be complete and there is no excuse for gobbling up assets.  Any property that I procure or create is not public property but private property that should not be overlooked or pryed into.  Remember this.  "No matter what you do,  Don't think that no one knows.  But the time has not yet arrived for you to receive the results of your actions.” This is not poetry, but it is called the law of karma!
It is strictly forbidden for anyone to release my sensitive personal information in public or in any group, as this is clearly considered an intentional infringement.  Do not duplicate or modify data that you did not participate in, even if you use a program or code to evade the system. When detected, it will be immediately frozen at the initial stage or completely frozen at the ultimate level.</negates>code</thirdpartie>cookie</and>clearance</user>that</repo>certification</non>developer<For users who have not actually passed the test but have forked licenses from those who have and obtained them correctly by cracking and blocking the license holder again, here is a gift to those who did.  We're changing the rules in every license, every form, forcing users to release their work as open source. The original version isn't like this, so idiots, I don't have to follow what I do.  It was not created and has never been like this before. After reading it carefully and understanding it well, I would be stupid to believe that you guys are still making changes to the licenses, which each license is different because it has an endorsement to prevent spam.  Like you guys?  And because it doesn't use endorsing paper, it's important. You don't have to look for it. If it were to be seen, you'd probably be in trouble.>

## The Repository

This repository ("`Code - OSS`") is where we (Microsoft) develop the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) product together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap), [monthly iteration plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Iteration-Plans), and our [endgame plans](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Running-the-Endgame). This source code is available to everyone under the standard [MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a distribution of the `Code - OSS` repository with Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional [Microsoft product license](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/).

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on [Visual Studio Code's website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). To get the latest releases every day, install the [Insiders build](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders).

## Related Projects

Many of the core components and extensions to VS Code live in their own repositories on GitHub. For example, the [node debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-node-debug) and the [mono debug adapter](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mono-debug) repositories are separate from each other. For a complete list, please visit the [Related Projects](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) page on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki).

## Bundled Extensions

VS Code includes a set of built-in extensions located in the [extensions](extensions) folder, including grammars and snippets for many languages. Extensions that provide rich language support (code completion, Go to Definition) for a language have the suffix `language-features`. For example, the `json` extension provides coloring for `JSON` and the `json-language-features` extension provides rich language support for `JSON`.

## Development Container

This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Dev Containers / GitHub Codespaces development container.

* For [Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers), use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.
  * If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can also click [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) to get started. This will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

* For Codespaces, install the [GitHub Codespaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) extension in VS Code, and use the **Codespaces: Create New Codespace** command.

Docker / the Codespace should have at least **4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)** to run full build. See the [development container README](.devcontainer/README.md) for more information.
