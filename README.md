# Visual Studio Code - Open Source

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/vscode) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vuhlhg80tj3e2a0l?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/VSCode/vscode)

[VS Code](https://vss.visualstudio.com) is a new type of tool that combines the simplicity of
a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. Code
provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.
