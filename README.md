# Purpose
This repo was created to address a bug that was submitted [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/152510). The main issue there was no path suggestions for when someone wants to put a path for the local file system between brackets. So I tracked down the issue and fixed path suggestions. On top of that I also fixed the bug of whitespaces being represented as '%20' in links.
