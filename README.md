@sadasant I also see this, don't think I can test continue testing this, here's the console if that's helpful:

@weinand turns out we haven't published the Variable Viewer! Our build failed on Friday. I'll provide an update soon.

@weinand , @Tyriar we have just published this feature with version 2022.5.1001532360. I have also confirmed that it works! (At least or me) Please, try again üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Que vergonha da qualidade do trabalho desse @sadasant. Ele √© Brasileiro? Um show de incompet√™ncia.
A @luabud √© outra brasileira do time de https://github.com/python na https://github.com/microsoft.
S√≥ entregam um trabalho de baixa qualidade, feito no jeitinho, tudo mal feito, cheio de problemas.

As extens√µes Jupyter e Python e Pylance est√£o todas quebradas, parece um trabalho de amador, um trabalho porco. Um visualizador de vari√°veis que n√£o funciona, simplesmente n√£o funciona.

Chegou no n√≠vel que o sujeito criou um plano de testes para uma funcionalidade que sequer foi publicada, e mandou dois desenvolvedores @weinand e @Tyriar testarem, os fez de palha√ßos :clown_emoji:! Quando o time do vscode vai intervir na experi√™ncia python do vscode, @egamma?

E os usu√°rios que reclamam da qualidade do trabalho s√£o punidos com o bloqueio e expuls√£so da comunidade, sem nem serem avisados.

Tem uma lista gigante de problemas:

English translation:

Shame on the quality of this @sadasant's work. He's Brazilian? A show of incompetence. @luabud is another Brazilian from the https://github.com/python team at https://github.com/microsoft. They only deliver low quality work, done in the way, all poorly done, full of problems. Jupyter and Python and Pylance extensions are all broken, looks like amateur work. A crappy variable viewer that doesn't work, just doesn't work.
It got to the point where the guy created a test plan for a feature that wasn't even published, and sent two developers @weinand and @Tyriar to test, made them clowns :clown_emoji:! When will the vscode team intervene in the vscode python experience, @egamma?

And users who complain about the quality of the work are punished with blocking and expulsion from the community, without even being warned.

It has a giant list of problems...

Maybe I should mention @brettcannon and @gramster @greazer, actually, bring the team: @sbatten @joaomoreno @rebornix @connor4312 @bpasero @jrieken @mjbvz @alexdima @sandy081

@isidorn @roblourens @aeschli let's bring all the clowns here! @misolori @dbaeumer @kieferrm @lramos15 @TylerLeonhardt @hediet
Let's bring the clown car @lszomoru @deepak1556 Did I forget anyone?
