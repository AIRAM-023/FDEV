## Frontmatter
[YAML Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is an authoringconvention popularized by Jekyll that provides a way to add metadata to pages.It is a block of key-value content that lives at the top of every Markdown file.
The following frontmatter values have special meanings and requirements for this site.There's also a schema that's used by the test suite to validate every page's frontmatter.See [`lib/frontmatter.js`](../lib/frontmatter.js).
### `versions`
- Purpose: Indicates the [versions](../lib/all-versions.js) to which a page applies.See [Versioning](#versioning) for more info.- Type: `Object`. Allowable keys map to product names and can be found in the `versions` object in [`lib/frontmatter.js`](../lib/frontmatter.js).- This frontmatter value is currently **required** for all pages.- The `*` is used to denote all releases for the version.
Example that applies to GitHub.com and recent versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:
```yamltitle: About your personal dashboardversions: fpt: '*' ghes: '>=2.20'```
Example that applies to all supported versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:(but not GitHub.com):
```yamltitle: Downloading your licenseversions: ghes: '*'```
You can also version a page for a range of releases. This would version the page for GitHub.com, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions 2.22 and 3.0 only:
```yamlversions: fpt: '*' ghes: '>=2.22 <3.1'```
### `redirect_from`
- Purpose: List URLs that should redirect to this page.- Type: `Array`- Optional
Example:
```yamltitle: Getting started with GitHub Desktopredirect_from: - /articles/first-launch/ - /articles/error-github-enterprise-version-is-too-old/ - /articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows/```
See [`contributing/redirects`](contributing/redirects.md) for more info.
### `title`
- Purpose: Set a human-friendly title for use in the rendered page's `<title>` tag and an `h1` element at the top of the page.- Type: `String`- Optional. If omitted, the page `<title>` will still be set, albeit with a generic value like `GitHub.com` or `GitHub Enterprise`.
### `shortTitle`
- Purpose: An abbreviated variant of the page title for use in breadcrumbs and navigation elements.- Type: `String`- Optional. If omitted, `title` will be used.
|Article type |Maximum character length |--- | --- | |articles	 | 31 ||categories	 |27 ||map topics	 |30 |
Example:
```yamltitle: Contributing to projects with GitHub DesktopshortTitle: Contributing to projects```
### `intro`
- Purpose: Sets the intro for the page. This string will render after the `title`.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `permissions`
- Purpose: Sets the permission statement for the article. This string will render after the `intro`.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `product`
- Purpose: Sets the product callout for the article. This string will render after the `intro` and `permissions` statement.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `layout`
- Purpose: Render the proper page layout.- Type: `String` that matches the name of the layout.For a layout named `components/landing`, the value would be `product-landing`.- Optional. If omitted, `DefaultLayout` is used.
### `children`
- Purpose: Lists the relative links that belong to the product/category/map topic. See [Index pages](#index-pages) for more info.- Type: `Array`. Default is `false`.- Required on `index.md` pages.
### `featuredLinks`
- Purpose: Renders the linked articles' titles and intros on product landing pages and the homepage.- Type: `Object`.- Optional.
The list of popular links are the links displayed on the landing page under the title "Popular." Alternately, you can customize the title "Popular" by setting the `featuredLinks.popularHeading` property to a new string.
Example:
```yamlfeaturedLinks: gettingStarted: - /path/to/page guides: - /guides/example popular: - /path/to/popular/article1 - /path/to/popular/article2 popularHeading: An alternate heading to Popular```
### `showMiniToc`
- Purpose: Indicates whether an article should show a mini TOC above the rest of the content. See [Autogenerated mini TOCs](#autogenerated-mini-tocs) for more info.- Type: `Boolean`. Default is `true` on articles, and `false` on map topics and `index.md` pages.- Optional.
### `miniTocMaxHeadingLevel`
- Purpose: Indicates the maximum heading level to include in an article's mini TOC. See [Autogenerated mini TOCs](#autogenerated-mini-tocs) for more info.- Type: `Number`. Default is `2`. Minimum is `2`. Maximum is `3`.- Optional.
### `allowTitleToDifferFromFilename`
- Purpose: Indicates whether a page is allowed to have a title that differs from its filename. For example, `content/rest/reference/orgs.md` has a title of `Organizations` instead of `Orgs`. Pages with this frontmatter set to `true` will not be flagged in tests or updated by `script/reconcile-ids-with-filenames.js`.- Type: `Boolean`. Default is `false`.- Optional.
### `changelog`
- Purpose: Render a list of items pulled from [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) on product landing pages (ex: `components/landing`). The one exception is Education, which pulls from https://github.blog/category/community/education.- Type: `Object`, properties: - `label` -- must be present and corresponds to the labels used in the [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) - `prefix` -- optional string that starts each changelog title that should be omitted in the docs feed. For example, with the prefix `GitHub Actions: ` specified, changelog titles like `GitHub Actions: Some Title Here` will render as `Some Title Here` in the docs feed).- Optional.
### `defaultPlatform`
- Purpose: Override the initial platform selection for a page. If this frontmatter is omitted, then the platform-specific content matching the reader's operating system is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable. For example, most GitHub Actions runners use Linux and their operating system is independent of the reader's operating system.- Type: `String`, one of: `mac`, `windows`, `linux`.- Optional.
Example:
```yamldefaultPlatform: linux```
### `defaultTool`
- Purpose: Override the initial tool selection for a page, where tool refers to the application the reader is using to work with GitHub (such as GitHub.com's web UI, the GitHub CLI, or GitHub Desktop) or the GitHub APIs (such as cURL or the GitHub CLI). If this frontmatter is omitted, then the tool-specific content matching the GitHub web UI is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable.- Type: `String`, one of: `webui`, `cli`, `desktop`, `curl`, `codespaces`, `vscode`.- Optional.
```yamldefaultTool: cli```
### `learningTracks`- Purpose: Render a list of learning tracks on a product's sub-landing page.- type: `String`. This should reference learning tracks' names defined in [`data/learning-tracks/*.yml`](../data/learning-tracks/README.md).- Optional
**Note: the featured track is set by a specific property in the learning tracks YAML. See that [README](../data/learning-tracks/README.md) for details.*
### `includeGuides`- Purpose: Render a list of articles, filterable by `type` and `topics`. Only applicable when used with `layout: product-sublanding`.- Type: `Array`- Optional.
Example:
```yamlincludeGuides: - /actions/guides/about-continuous-integration - /actions/guides/setting-up-continuous-integration-using-workflow-templates - /actions/guides/building-and-testing-nodejs - /actions/guides/building-and-testing-powershell```
### `type`- Purpose: Indicate the type of article.- Type: `String`, one of the `overview`, `quick_start`, `tutorial`, `how_to`, `reference`.- Optional.
### `topics`- Purpose: Indicate the topics covered by the article. The topics are used to filter guides on some landing pages. For example, the guides at the bottom of [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides) can be filtered by topics and the topics are listed under the guide intro. Topics are also added to all search records that get created for each page. The search records contain a `topics` property that is used to filter search results by topics. For more information, see the [Search](/contributing/search.md) contributing guide. Refer to the content models for more details around adding topics. A full list of existing topics is located in the [allowed topics file](/data/allowed-topics.js). If topics in article frontmatter and the allow-topics list become out of sync, the [topics CI test](/tests/unit/search/topics.js) will fail.- Type: Array of `String`s- Optional: Topics are preferred for each article, but, there may be cases where existing articles don't yet have topics or a adding a topic to a new article may not add value.
### `contributor`- Purpose: Indicate an article is contributed and maintained by a third-party organization, typically a GitHub Technology Partner.- Type: `Object`. Properties are `name` and `URL`.- Optional.
### `communityRedirect`- Purpose: Set a custom link and link name for `Ask the GitHub community` link in the footer.- Type: `Object`. Properties are `name` and `href`.- Optional.
Example:
```yamlcontributor: name: ACME, inc. URL: https://acme.example.com/```
### Escaping single quotes
If you see two single quotes in a row (`''`) in YML frontmatter where you might expect to see one (`'`), this is the YML-preferred way to escape a single quote. From [the YAML spec](https://yaml.org/spec/history/2001-12-10.html):
> In single quoted leaves, a single quote character needs to be escaped. This is done by repeating the character.
As an alternative, you can change the single quotes surrounding the frontmatter field to double quotes and leave interior single quotes unescaped.
## Autogenerated mini TOCs
Every article on the help site displays an autogenerated "In this article" section (aka mini TOC) at the top of the page that includes links to all `H2`s in the article by default.
* To make the mini TOC include additional (or fewer) heading levels, you can add [`miniTocMaxHeadingLevel` frontmatter](#miniTocMaxHeadingLevel) to specify the maximum heading level. For example: `miniTocMaxHeadingLevel: 3`* To disable the mini TOC for a specific article, you can add this frontmatter: [`showMiniToc: false`](#showMiniToc)
Mini TOCs do not appear on product landing pages, category landing pages, or map topic pages.
Make sure not to add hardcoded "In this article" sections in the Markdown source or else the page will display duplicate mini TOCs.
## Versioning
A content file can have **two** types of versioning:
* [`versions`](#versions) frontmatter (**required**) * Determines in which the versions the page is available. See [contributing/permalinks](../contributing/permalinks.md) for more info.* Liquid statements in content (**optional**) * Conditionally render content depending on the current version being viewed. See [contributing/liquid-helpers](../contributing/liquid-helpers.md) for more info. Note Liquid conditionals can also appear in `data` and `include` files.
### Free-pro-team vs. GitHub.com versioning
As of early 2021, the `free-pro-team@latest` version is **only** supported in content files (in both frontmatter and Liquid versioning) and throughout the docs site backend. It is **not** user facing. A helper function called `lib/remove-fpt-from-path.js` removes the version from URLs. Users now select `GitHub.com` in the Article Versions dropdown instead of `Free, Pro, Team`.
The convenience function allows us to continue supporting a consistent versioning structure under-the-hood while not displaying plan information to users that may be potentially confusing.
## Filenames
When adding a new article, make sure the filename is a [kebab-cased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) version of the title you use in the article's [`title`](#title) frontmatter. This can get tricky when a title has punctuation (such as "GitHub's Billing Plans"). A test will flag any discrepancies between title and filename. To override this requirement for a given article, you can add [`allowTitleToDifferFromFilename`](#allowtitletodifferfromfilename) frontmatter.
## Whitespace control
When using Liquid conditionals in lists or tables, you can use [whitespace control](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/whitespace/) characters to prevent the addition of newlines that would break the list or table rendering.
Just add a hyphen on either the left, right, or both sides to indicate that there should be no newline on that side. For example, this statement removes a newline on the left side:
```{%- ifversion fpt %}```
## Links and image paths
Local links must start with a product ID (like `/actions` or `/admin`), and image paths must start with `/assets`. The links to Markdown pages undergo some transformations on the server side to match the current page's language and version. The handling for these transformations lives in [`lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links`](lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links.js).
For example, if you include the following link in a content file:
```/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```When viewed on GitHub.com docs, the link gets rendered with the language code:```/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```and when viewed on GitHub Enterprise Server docs, the version is included as well:```/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```
There are transformations for image paths in GitHub Enterprise Server (versions 2.20-3.0) only. Once those versions are deprecation, there will no longer be any transformations for image paths. For more information, see [/assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md](/assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md).
### Preventing transformations
Sometimes you want to link to a Dotcom-only article in Enterprise content and you don't want the link to be Enterprise-ified. To prevent the transformation, write the link using HTML and add a class of `dotcom-only`. For example:
```html<a href="/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service" class="dotcom-only">GitHub's Terms of Service</a>```
Sometimes the canonical home of content moves outside the docs site. None of the links included in [`lib/redirects/external-sites.json`](/lib/redirects/external-sites.json) get rewritten. See [`contributing/redirects.md`](/contributing/redirects.md) for more info about this type of redirect.
### Index pages
Index pages are the Table of Contents files for the docs site.

## Frontmatter
[YAML Frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) is an authoringconvention popularized by Jekyll that provides a way to add metadata to pages.It is a block of key-value content that lives at the top of every Markdown file.
The following frontmatter values have special meanings and requirements for this site.There's also a schema that's used by the test suite to validate every page's frontmatter.See [`lib/frontmatter.js`](../lib/frontmatter.js).
### `versions`
- Purpose: Indicates the [versions](../lib/all-versions.js) to which a page applies.See [Versioning](#versioning) for more info.- Type: `Object`. Allowable keys map to product names and can be found in the `versions` object in [`lib/frontmatter.js`](../lib/frontmatter.js).- This frontmatter value is currently **required** for all pages.- The `*` is used to denote all releases for the version.
Example that applies to GitHub.com and recent versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:
```yamltitle: About your personal dashboardversions: fpt: '*' ghes: '>=2.20'```
Example that applies to all supported versions of GitHub Enterprise Server:(but not GitHub.com):
```yamltitle: Downloading your licenseversions: ghes: '*'```
You can also version a page for a range of releases. This would version the page for GitHub.com, and GitHub Enterprise Server versions 2.22 and 3.0 only:
```yamlversions: fpt: '*' ghes: '>=2.22 <3.1'```
### `redirect_from`
- Purpose: List URLs that should redirect to this page.- Type: `Array`- Optional
Example:
```yamltitle: Getting started with GitHub Desktopredirect_from: - /articles/first-launch/ - /articles/error-github-enterprise-version-is-too-old/ - /articles/getting-started-with-github-for-windows/```
See [`contributing/redirects`](contributing/redirects.md) for more info.
### `title`
- Purpose: Set a human-friendly title for use in the rendered page's `<title>` tag and an `h1` element at the top of the page.- Type: `String`- Optional. If omitted, the page `<title>` will still be set, albeit with a generic value like `GitHub.com` or `GitHub Enterprise`.
### `shortTitle`
- Purpose: An abbreviated variant of the page title for use in breadcrumbs and navigation elements.- Type: `String`- Optional. If omitted, `title` will be used.
|Article type |Maximum character length |--- | --- | |articles	 | 31 ||categories	 |27 ||map topics	 |30 |
Example:
```yamltitle: Contributing to projects with GitHub DesktopshortTitle: Contributing to projects```
### `intro`
- Purpose: Sets the intro for the page. This string will render after the `title`.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `permissions`
- Purpose: Sets the permission statement for the article. This string will render after the `intro`.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `product`
- Purpose: Sets the product callout for the article. This string will render after the `intro` and `permissions` statement.- Type: `String`- Optional.
### `layout`
- Purpose: Render the proper page layout.- Type: `String` that matches the name of the layout.For a layout named `components/landing`, the value would be `product-landing`.- Optional. If omitted, `DefaultLayout` is used.
### `children`
- Purpose: Lists the relative links that belong to the product/category/map topic. See [Index pages](#index-pages) for more info.- Type: `Array`. Default is `false`.- Required on `index.md` pages.
### `featuredLinks`
- Purpose: Renders the linked articles' titles and intros on product landing pages and the homepage.- Type: `Object`.- Optional.
The list of popular links are the links displayed on the landing page under the title "Popular." Alternately, you can customize the title "Popular" by setting the `featuredLinks.popularHeading` property to a new string.
Example:
```yamlfeaturedLinks: gettingStarted: - /path/to/page guides: - /guides/example popular: - /path/to/popular/article1 - /path/to/popular/article2 popularHeading: An alternate heading to Popular```
### `showMiniToc`
- Purpose: Indicates whether an article should show a mini TOC above the rest of the content. See [Autogenerated mini TOCs](#autogenerated-mini-tocs) for more info.- Type: `Boolean`. Default is `true` on articles, and `false` on map topics and `index.md` pages.- Optional.
### `miniTocMaxHeadingLevel`
- Purpose: Indicates the maximum heading level to include in an article's mini TOC. See [Autogenerated mini TOCs](#autogenerated-mini-tocs) for more info.- Type: `Number`. Default is `2`. Minimum is `2`. Maximum is `3`.- Optional.
### `allowTitleToDifferFromFilename`
- Purpose: Indicates whether a page is allowed to have a title that differs from its filename. For example, `content/rest/reference/orgs.md` has a title of `Organizations` instead of `Orgs`. Pages with this frontmatter set to `true` will not be flagged in tests or updated by `script/reconcile-ids-with-filenames.js`.- Type: `Boolean`. Default is `false`.- Optional.
### `changelog`
- Purpose: Render a list of items pulled from [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) on product landing pages (ex: `components/landing`). The one exception is Education, which pulls from https://github.blog/category/community/education.- Type: `Object`, properties: - `label` -- must be present and corresponds to the labels used in the [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) - `prefix` -- optional string that starts each changelog title that should be omitted in the docs feed. For example, with the prefix `GitHub Actions: ` specified, changelog titles like `GitHub Actions: Some Title Here` will render as `Some Title Here` in the docs feed).- Optional.
### `defaultPlatform`
- Purpose: Override the initial platform selection for a page. If this frontmatter is omitted, then the platform-specific content matching the reader's operating system is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable. For example, most GitHub Actions runners use Linux and their operating system is independent of the reader's operating system.- Type: `String`, one of: `mac`, `windows`, `linux`.- Optional.
Example:
```yamldefaultPlatform: linux```
### `defaultTool`
- Purpose: Override the initial tool selection for a page, where tool refers to the application the reader is using to work with GitHub (such as GitHub.com's web UI, the GitHub CLI, or GitHub Desktop) or the GitHub APIs (such as cURL or the GitHub CLI). If this frontmatter is omitted, then the tool-specific content matching the GitHub web UI is shown by default. This behavior can be changed for individual pages, for which a manual selection is more reasonable.- Type: `String`, one of: `webui`, `cli`, `desktop`, `curl`, `codespaces`, `vscode`.- Optional.
```yamldefaultTool: cli```
### `learningTracks`- Purpose: Render a list of learning tracks on a product's sub-landing page.- type: `String`. This should reference learning tracks' names defined in [`data/learning-tracks/*.yml`](../data/learning-tracks/README.md).- Optional
**Note: the featured track is set by a specific property in the learning tracks YAML. See that [README](../data/learning-tracks/README.md) for details.*
### `includeGuides`- Purpose: Render a list of articles, filterable by `type` and `topics`. Only applicable when used with `layout: product-sublanding`.- Type: `Array`- Optional.
Example:
```yamlincludeGuides: - /actions/guides/about-continuous-integration - /actions/guides/setting-up-continuous-integration-using-workflow-templates - /actions/guides/building-and-testing-nodejs - /actions/guides/building-and-testing-powershell```
### `type`- Purpose: Indicate the type of article.- Type: `String`, one of the `overview`, `quick_start`, `tutorial`, `how_to`, `reference`.- Optional.
### `topics`- Purpose: Indicate the topics covered by the article. The topics are used to filter guides on some landing pages. For example, the guides at the bottom of [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides) can be filtered by topics and the topics are listed under the guide intro. Topics are also added to all search records that get created for each page. The search records contain a `topics` property that is used to filter search results by topics. For more information, see the [Search](/contributing/search.md) contributing guide. Refer to the content models for more details around adding topics. A full list of existing topics is located in the [allowed topics file](/data/allowed-topics.js). If topics in article frontmatter and the allow-topics list become out of sync, the [topics CI test](/tests/unit/search/topics.js) will fail.- Type: Array of `String`s- Optional: Topics are preferred for each article, but, there may be cases where existing articles don't yet have topics or a adding a topic to a new article may not add value.
### `contributor`- Purpose: Indicate an article is contributed and maintained by a third-party organization, typically a GitHub Technology Partner.- Type: `Object`. Properties are `name` and `URL`.- Optional.
### `communityRedirect`- Purpose: Set a custom link and link name for `Ask the GitHub community` link in the footer.- Type: `Object`. Properties are `name` and `href`.- Optional.
Example:
```yamlcontributor: name: ACME, inc. URL: https://acme.example.com/```
### Escaping single quotes
If you see two single quotes in a row (`''`) in YML frontmatter where you might expect to see one (`'`), this is the YML-preferred way to escape a single quote. From [the YAML spec](https://yaml.org/spec/history/2001-12-10.html):
> In single quoted leaves, a single quote character needs to be escaped. This is done by repeating the character.As an alternative, you can change the single quotes surrounding the frontmatter field to double quotes and leave interior single quotes unescaped.
## Autogenerated mini TOCs
Every article on the help site displays an autogenerated "In this article" section (aka mini TOC) at the top of the page that includes links to all `H2`s in the article by default.
* To make the mini TOC include additional (or fewer) heading levels, you can add [`miniTocMaxHeadingLevel` frontmatter](#miniTocMaxHeadingLevel) to specify the maximum heading level. For example: `miniTocMaxHeadingLevel: 3`* To disable the mini TOC for a specific article, you can add this frontmatter: [`showMiniToc: false`](#showMiniToc)
Mini TOCs do not appear on product landing pages, category landing pages, or map topic pages.
Make sure not to add hardcoded "In this article" sections in the Markdown source or else the page will display duplicate mini TOCs.
## Versioning
A content file can have **two** types of versioning:
* [`versions`](#versions) frontmatter (**required**) * Determines in which the versions the page is available. See [contributing/permalinks](../contributing/permalinks.md) for more info.* Liquid statements in content (**optional**) * Conditionally render content depending on the current version being viewed. See [contributing/liquid-helpers](../contributing/liquid-helpers.md) for more info. Note Liquid conditionals can also appear in `data` and `include` files.
### Free-pro-team vs. GitHub.com versioning
As of early 2021, the `free-pro-team@latest` version is **only** supported in content files (in both frontmatter and Liquid versioning) and throughout the docs site backend. It is **not** user facing. A helper function called `lib/remove-fpt-from-path.js` removes the version from URLs. Users now select `GitHub.com` in the Article Versions dropdown instead of `Free, Pro, Team`.
The convenience function allows us to continue supporting a consistent versioning structure under-the-hood while not displaying plan information to users that may be potentially confusing.
## Filenames
When adding a new article, make sure the filename is a [kebab-cased](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles) version of the title you use in the article's [`title`](#title) frontmatter. This can get tricky when a title has punctuation (such as "GitHub's Billing Plans"). A test will flag any discrepancies between title and filename. To override this requirement for a given article, you can add [`allowTitleToDifferFromFilename`](#allowtitletodifferfromfilename) frontmatter.
## Whitespace control
When using Liquid conditionals in lists or tables, you can use [whitespace control](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/whitespace/) characters to prevent the addition of newlines that would break the list or table rendering.
Just add a hyphen on either the left, right, or both sides to indicate that there should be no newline on that side. For example, this statement removes a newline on the left side:
```{%- ifversion fpt %}```
## Links and image paths
Local links must start with a product ID (like `/actions` or `/admin`), and image paths must start with `/assets`. The links to Markdown pages undergo some transformations on the server side to match the current page's language and version. The handling for these transformations lives in [`lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links`](lib/render-content/plugins/rewrite-local-links.js).
For example, if you include the following link in a content file:
```/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```When viewed on GitHub.com docs, the link gets rendered with the language code:```/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```and when viewed on GitHub Enterprise Server docs, the version is included as well:```/en/enterprise-server@2.20/github/writing-on-github/creating-a-saved-reply```
There are transformations for image paths in GitHub Enterprise Server (versions 2.20-3.0) only. Once those versions are deprecation, there will no longer be any transformations for image paths. For more information, see [/assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md](/assets/images/enterprise/legacy-format/README.md).
### Preventing transformations
Sometimes you want to link to a Dotcom-only article in Enterprise content and you don't want the link to be Enterprise-ified. To prevent the transformation, write the link using HTML and add a class of `dotcom-only`. For example:
```html<a href="/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service" class="dotcom-only">GitHub's Terms of Service</a>```
Sometimes the canonical home of content moves outside the docs site. None of the links included in [`lib/redirects/external-sites.json`](/lib/redirects/external-sites.json) get rewritten. See [`contributing/redirects.md`](/contributing/redirects.md) for more info about this type of redirect.
### Index pages
Index pages are the Table of Contents files for the docs site. Every product, category, and map topic subdirectory has an `index.md` that serves as the landing page. Each `index.md` must contain a `children` frontmatter property with a list of relative links to the child pages of the product, category, or map topic.
**Important note**: The site only knows about paths included in `children` frontmatter. If a directory or article exists but is **not** included in `children`, its path will 404.
### Creating new sublanding pages
To create a sublanding page (e.g. [Actions' Guide page](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides)), create or modify an existing markdown file with these specific frontmatter values:
1. Use the sublanding page template by referencing it `layout: product-sublanding`2. (optional) Include the learning tracks in [`learningTracks`](#learningTracks)3. (optional) Define which articles to include with [`includeGuides`](#includeGuides).
If using learning tracks, they need to be defined in [`data/learning-tracks/*.yml`](../data/learning-tracks/README.md).If using `includeGuides`, make sure each of the articles in this list has [`topics`](#topics) and [`type`](#type) in its frontmatter.
