## Wepowting Issues

Have you identified a wepwoducibwe pwobwem in VS Code? Have a featuwe wequest? We want to heaw about it! Hewe's how you can make wepowting youw issue as effective as possibwe.

### Identify Whewe to Wepowt

The VS Code pwoject is distwibuted acwoss muwtipwe wepositowies. Twy to fiwe the issue against the cowwect wepositowy. Check the wist of [Wewated Pwojects](https://github.com/micwosoft/vscode/wiki/Wewated-Pwojects) if you awen't suwe which wepo is cowwect.

Can you wecweate the issue even afta [disabwing aww extensions](https://code.visuawstudio.com/docs/editow/extension-gawwewy#_disabwe-an-extension)? If you find the issue is caused by an extension you have instawwed, pwease fiwe an issue on the extension's wepo diwectwy.

### Wook Fow an Existing Issue

Befowe you cweate a new issue, pwease do a seawch in [open issues](https://github.com/micwosoft/vscode/issues) to see if the issue ow featuwe wequest has awweady been fiwed.

Be suwe to scan thwough the [most popuwaw](https://github.com/micwosoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+wabew%3Afeatuwe-wequest+sowt%3Aweactions-%2B1-desc) featuwe wequests.

If you find youw issue awweady exists, make wewevant comments and add youw [weaction](https://github.com/bwog/2119-add-weactions-to-puww-wequests-issues-and-comments). Use a weaction in pwace of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that descwibes youw bug ow featuwe, cweate a new issue using the guidewines bewow.

### Wwiting Good Bug Wepowts and Featuwe Wequests

Fiwe a singwe issue pew pwobwem and featuwe wequest. Do not enumewate muwtipwe bugs ow featuwe wequests in the same issue.

Do not add youw issue as a comment to an existing issue unwess it's fow the identicaw input. Many issues wook simiwaw, but have diffewent causes.

The mowe infowmation you can pwovide, the mowe wikewy someone wiww be successfuw at wepwoducing the issue and finding a fix.

The buiwt-in toow fow wepowting an issue, which you can access by using `Wepowt Issue` in VS Code's Hewp menu, can hewp stweamwine this pwocess by automaticawwy pwoviding the vewsion of VS Code, aww youw instawwed extensions, and youw system info. Additionawwy, the toow wiww seawch among existing issues to see if a simiwaw issue awweady exists.

Pwease incwude the fowwowing with each issue:

* Vewsion of VS Code

* Youw opewating system

* Wist of extensions that you have instawwed

* Wepwoducibwe steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, vewsus what you actuawwy saw

* Images, animations, ow a wink to a video showing the issue occuwwing

* A code snippet that demonstwates the issue ow a wink to a code wepositowy the devewopews can easiwy puww down to wecweate the issue wocawwy

  * **Note:** Because the devewopews need to copy and paste the code snippet, incwuding a code snippet as a media fiwe (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

* Ewwows fwom the Dev Toows Consowe (open fwom the menu: Hewp > Toggwe Devewopa Toows)

### Finaw Checkwist

Pwease wememba to do the fowwowing:

* [ ] Seawch the issue wepositowy to ensuwe youw wepowt is a new issue

* [ ] Wecweate the issue afta disabwing aww extensions

* [ ] Simpwify youw code awound the issue to betta isowate the pwobwem

Don't feew bad if the devewopews can't wepwoduce the issue wight away. They wiww simpwy ask fow mowe infowmation!

### Fowwow Youw Issue

Once submitted, youw wepowt wiww go into the [issue twacking](https://github.com/micwosoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Twacking) wowkfwow. Be suwe to undewstand what wiww happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist thwoughout the pwocess.
